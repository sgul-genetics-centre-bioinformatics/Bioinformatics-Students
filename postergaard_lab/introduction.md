# Research Focus
## Primary Lymphoedema 

Lymphatic malformation or dysfunction can lead to Primary Lymphoedema, which is an inherited form of this disorder. Primary Lymphoedema is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and is caused by defects in the lymphatic system that lead to swelling of one or more limbs or other parts of the body. It is a rare disorder (1 in 6000) and in the more extreme forms can increase mortality, especially in infants.

Lymphoedema is a lifelong, often disabling condition associated with a high morbidity with distressing swelling of the affected limbs, recurrent cellulitis, discomfort and significant skin changes. Treatment is limited to compression garments and manual lymphatic drainage. Many patients find Primary Lymphoedema debilitating, embarrassing, stressful and painful leading to considerable psychological morbidity.

Dr Ostergaard’s research group has focused on the genetic causes of lymphatic failure. Seven genes have recently been identified by the group: EPHB4, GATA2, GJA1, GJC2, KIF11, PIEZO1, and VEGFC in seven clinically homogenous phenotypic sub-classifications of Primary Lymphoedema using exome sequencing techniques. Finding the genetic causes of lymphatic dysfunction in Primary Lymphoedema, increases our understanding of the development of the lymphatic system, and our results feed into the basic research on the lymphovascular system.

There still remain numerous Primary Lymphoedema patients where a genetic cause is yet to be identified. The identification of further disease causing genes is crucial in understanding the molecular pathways and mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis, and will ultimately lead to the formation of novel and more effective treatments. Genetic advances in Primary Lymphoedema will also benefit patients through accurate molecular diagnosis.

## Lipoedema

The Lymphovascular Research Group at St George's has had an interest in lipoedema for a number of years as many cases are seen in our primary lymphoedema clinic. There is often a family history of lipoedema, suggesting a genetic origin, but the level of genetic heterogeneity is currently unclear. Many sporadic cases have also been ascertained, and it seems likely that there is a more complex background to the disease than single gene Mendelian inheritance. The present hypothesis from our group is that there is a genetic component to lipedema, and it is this hypothesis that we wish to investigate further.

## What are we trying to do?
We have a rich repository of blood samples from Primary Lymphoedema and Lipoedema patients and sometimes their families. We perform Whole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing on these samples and after careful data analysis we are trying to identify human genetic variations that might be causing these inherited conditions in the under-investigation patients.

### Example:
This is family A. The father and one of the children have [Yellow Nail Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_nail_syndrome) which is a very rare **autosomal dominant** medical syndrome that includes pleural effusions, lymphedema (due to under development of the lymphatic vessels) and yellow dystrophic nails.

We want to identify the genetic cause for this inherited condition in this family. To do that we perform Whole Exome Sequencing on all family members and we try to identify human genetic variants (Single Nucleotide Polymporphisms SNPs - Small Indels - Larger Chromosomal Abberations). Since it is an autosomal dominant condition we expect that the affected father and affected daughter will probably share the same mutated allele compared to the unaffected mother and daughter which will probably share the wild-type allele.

Having this in mind we can filter the variant data and find our candidate variants for this family.

Similar strategy can be applied to 
- Singletons: In this case it's harder to filter the candidate causal variants since we don't have anaffected family members to compare against
- Larger families: In this case we have more family members that will share mutated or wild-type alleles and therefore will be easier to end-up with a more realistic list of candidate variants.
